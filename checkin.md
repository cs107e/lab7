title: 'Lab 7: Check-in'

During lab, we encourage you to check your understanding with a TA after completing a section or two, while the material is still fresh in your mind.

Each question below is a diagnostic question for each section of the lab. Try answering one after finishing each section to test your understanding.

1. How is a function "attached" as an interrupt handler? If there are multiple attached handlers, how is decided which one processes a given interrupt?

2. Why is it necessary for the `gCount` variable to be declared `volatile`? What happens if it is not?

3. How does the program behave if the handler does not clear the event before returning?

4. Why might you want the handler to enqueue an update and return instead of doing the actual task (e.g. redraw) directly in the handler?


Before leaving the lab, check in with a TA and discuss any challenges to answering the questions in the lab. If you do not feel confident about your responses, please ask us about it too!
